What I Learned
While building this project, I realized that I still have a lot to practice as I am at the beginner level. I havenâ€™t fully grasped all the key concepts, and this project highlighted areas where I need to improve. I also learned the importance of consistent practice to solidify my understanding.

Challenges Faced
One of the main challenges I faced was fitting the image into the card properly. Initially, the image was either too large, too small, or not aligned correctly. With guidance from ChatGPT, I learned how to create an image container with proper sizing and positioning, which helped me solve the issue.

Continued Development
In future projects, I want to:
Practice more with responsive design.
Improve my understanding of CSS positioning techniques (Flexbox, Grid, etc.).
Work on consistency and regular coding practice to build confidence.

Useful Resources
Youtube- Provided step-by-step guidance on building the layout and solving the image container issue.
